- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for a modern, neutral design.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', also sans-serif, to differentiate from the body and establish hierarchy.
- Minimal, outline-style icons for UI elements.
- Clean and spacious layout with clear visual hierarchy to ensure readability and usability.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience when visualizing new commits.
